TCP ignores retransmissions when measuring SampleRTT. Discuss
why.

2 Why does TCP use fast retransmit after “3” duplicate ACKs? Why
not after one duplicate ACK?

Why does the 3-way handshake only cause 1 RTT delay instead of
1.5 RTT?

4 Discuss what happens if traffic intensity (ρ = La/R) becomes close to 1

5 Explain the terms: congestion window, sending rate, bandwidth
probing.

Describe what TCP slow start means and why slow start is used.

7 Explain loss-based, delay-based, and network assisted congestion contorl
